abstract = {As concerns about the change in global climate and the loss of biodiversity have mounted, attention has focused on the depletion of the ozone layer and the destruction of tropical rainforests. But recently scientists have identified another seriously endangered ecosystem: coral reefs. In Corals in Space and Time, J.E.N. Veron provides a richly detailed study of corals that will inform investigations of these fragile ecosystems. Drawing on twenty-five years of research, Veron brings together extensive field observations about the taxonomy, biogeography, paleontology, and biology of corals. After introducing coral taxonomy and biogeography, as well as relevant aspects of coral biology for the non-specialist, he provides an interpretation of the fossil record and paleoclimates, an analysis of modern coral distribution, and a discussion of the evolutionary nature and origins of coral species. Revealing a sharp conflict between empirical observations about the geographical variation within species, Veron introduces a non-Darwinian theory of coral evolution. He proposes that the evolution of coral species is driven not primarily by natural selection, but by constantly shifting patterns of ocean circulation, which produce changing variations of genetic connectivity. This mechanism of speciation and hybridization has far-reaching consequences for the study of all types of corals and potentially many other groups of organisms as well.},

abstract = {his paper is a minireview on aquariology, the mysteries of the submersed universe: history, the present state and the future perspectives. Ornamental fishery or aquariology is the science dealing with the study of an environment isolated from the natural environment it originates from, incorporated in an aquarium. The main animals in an aquarium are the exotic fish which were initially captured from their wild environment, but after consecutive accommodations and reproduction, many species are traded, having their origin still in the aquarium. Besides fish, the aquarium may accommodate mollusks and other aquatic invertebrates, which help maintaining the balance of the aquarium by consuming food scraps and algae. Aquariology is a branch of aquaculture which may be practiced in a protected environment, dealing with description, growth, reproduction, and exploitation of some fish species and compatible plants. The psychiatrists study for a long time the profound motivations impelling people to maintain, look after, and attend to aquariology. The beneficial effect of aquariums in the therapy of psychological conditions of the sufferings has been scientifically proven, which led to installation of aquariums in some medical clinics, orphanages or retirement homes. Aquariology is an ancient occupation and its story does not end here. The future of aquariology holds many wonders for which life must be lived.},

The photosynthetic pigments of the brown symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) isolated from five tridacnid clams and nine corals were found to be identical with the pigments of the dinoflagellate Amphidinium.

Both zooxanthellae and dinoflagellates contained cholorphylls a and c, $\beta$-carotene, peridinin, neo-peridinin, dinoxanthin, neo-dinoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, and three minor xanthophyll fractions not previously described.2. Peridinin, crystallized from Tridacna gigas, or isolated by paper chromatography from Tridacna crocea, Pocillopora or the dinoflagellate Amphidinium, showed similar absorption characteristics in different solvents. The extinction coefficient of crystalline peridinin in acetone was E1 cm1{\%} 1340.3. Clam zooxanthellae (and the dinoflagellates Amphidinium and Gymnodinium) contained a much higher proportion of chlorophyll c than coral zooxanthellae.4.

This preliminary study explores an alternative approach by trying to account for the energy fixed in photosynthesis in terms of expenditure, storage and loss. The energy budget so derived for Pocillopora eydouxi suggests that about 51{\%} of the photosynthetically fixed energy is used in respiration, 0.9{\%} in growth and 48{\%} is unaccounted for and presumably lost from the colony. By partitioning the energy budget, it is found that 24{\%} of the respiration and 11{\%} of the energy retained in growth is attributable to the zooxanthellae. It is postulated that nutritionally, a coral is analogous to an aphid in being supplied with a high carbon diet and in being obliged to excrete the excess, probably in the form of mucus.},

This study examined the effects of floodwaters on nearshore coral communities, in 3 regions of the Great Barrier Reef. The Keppel Island reefs (23 degrees 10' S) were affected by extreme floodwaters which damaged corals to an average depth of 1.3 m below low water datum. Mortality was highest for shallow Acropora spp. and pocilloporids; faviids were most tolerant. The most widespread effect on deeper colonies of Acropora spp. was gross swelling and lysis of the epidermal cells and loss of zooxanthellae from the gastrodermis (bleaching). Shallow waters around Middle Reef (19 degrees 09' S) experienced moderate floodwaters and significant mortality occurred to colonies of Acropora spp.; other corals were not damaged. The Whitsunday Island reefs (20 degrees 20' S) were subjected to minor floodwaters and shallow corals suffered little damage; however deep-water pocilloporids died, possibly because of low incident light during the tropical depression.},

The study revealed a number of cellular mechanisms which would result in reduced zooxanthellae densities in bleached corals. These included degeneration of zooxanthellae in situ, release of zooxanthellae from mesenterial filaments and, for two species in an advanced state of bleaching, release of algae within host cells which became detached from the endoderm. The existence of a number of cellular mechanisms of zooxanthellae loss in naturally-bleached tissues contrasts with previous descriptions of a single predominant mechanism of zooxanthellae release in laboratory simulations, and highlights the importance of complementing laboratory studies with relevant field observations.},

abstract = {Desalination of seawater is an increasingly common means by which nations satisfy demand for water. Desalination has a long history in the Middle East and Mediterranean, but expanding capacities can be found in the United States, Europe and Australia. There is therefore increasing global interest in understanding the environmental impacts of desalination plants and their discharges on the marine environment. Here we review environmental, ecological and toxicological research in this arena including monitoring and assessment of water quality and ecological attributes in receiving environments. The greatest environmental and ecological impacts have occurred around older multi-stage flash (MSF) plants discharging to water bodies with little flushing. These discharge scenarios can lead to substantial increases in salinity and temperature, and the accumulation of metals, hydrocarbons and toxic anti-fouling compounds in receiving waters. Experiments in the field and laboratory clearly demonstrate the potential for acute and chronic toxicity, and small-scale alterations to community structure following exposures to environmentally realistic concentrations of desalination brines. A clear consensus across many of the reviewed articles is that discharge site selection is the primary factor that determines the extent of ecological impacts of desalination plants. Ecological monitoring studies have found variable effects ranging from no significant impacts to benthic communities, through to widespread alterations to community structure in seagrass, coral reef and soft-sediment ecosystems when discharges are released to poorly flushed environments. In most other cases environmental effects appear to be limited to within 10. s of meters of outfalls. It must be noted that a large proportion of the published work is descriptive and provides little quantitative data that we could assess independently. Many of the monitoring studies lacked sufficient detail with respect to study design and statistical analyses, making conclusive interpretation of results difficult. It is clear that greater clarity and improved methodologies are required in the assessment of the ecological impacts of desalination plants. It is imperative to employ Before-After, Control-Impact monitoring designs with adequate replication, and multiple independent reference locations to assess potential impacts adequately. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The phylogeny of Cnidaria has been a source of debate for decades, during which nearly all-possible relationships among the major lineages have been proposed. The ecological success of Cnidaria is predicated on several fascinating organismal innovations including symbiosis, colonial body plans and elaborate life histories, however, understanding the origins and subsequent diversification of these traits remains difficult due to persistent uncertainty surrounding the evolutionary relationships within Cnidaria. While recent phylogenomic studies have advanced our knowledge of the cnidarian tree of life, no analysis to date has included genome scale data for each major cnidarian lineage. Here we describe a well-supported hypothesis for cnidarian phylogeny based on phylogenomic analyses of new and existing genome scale data that includes representatives of all cnidarian classes. Our results are robust to alternative modes of phylogenetic estimation and phylogenomic dataset construction. We show that two popular phylogenomic matrix construction pipelines yield profoundly different datasets, both in the identities and the functional classes of the loci they include, but resolve the same topology. We then leverage our phylogenetic resolution of Cnidaria to understand the character histories of several critical organismal traits. Ancestral state reconstruction analyses based on our phylogeny establish several notable organismal transitions in the evolutionary history of Cnidaria and depict the ancestral cnidarian as a solitary, non-symbiotic polyp that lacked a medusa stage. In addition, Bayes factor tests of multiple origins strongly suggest that symbiosis has evolved multiple times independently across the cnidarian radiation. Cnidaria have experienced more than 600 million years of independent evolution and in the process generated an array of organismal innovations. Our results add significant clarification on the cnidarian tree of life and the histories of these innovations. Further, we confirm the existence of Acraspeda (staurozoans plus scyphozoans and cubozoans), thus reviving an evolutionary hypothesis put forward more than a century ago.},

abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay. By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis, respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P {\textgreater} 0.01), but short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure, however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface, which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However, any environmentally realistic model must include other potential stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental contaminants.},

abstract = {Desalination of seawater accounts for a worldwide water production of 24.5 million m3/day. A "hot spot" of intense desalination activity has always been the Arabian Gulf, but other regional centers of activity emerge and become more prominent, such as the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, or the coastal waters of California, China and Australia. Despite the many benefits the technology has to offer, concerns rise over potential negative impacts on the environment. Key issues are the concentrate and chemical discharges to the marine environment, the emissions of air pollutants and the energy demand of the processes. To safeguard a sustainable use of desalination technology, the impacts of each major desalination project should be investigated and mitigated by means of a project- and location-specific environmental impact assessment (EIA) study, while the benefits and impacts of different water supply options should be balanced on the scale of regional management plans. In this context, our paper intends to present an overview on present seawater desalination capacities by region, a synopsis of the key environmental concerns of desalination, including ways of mitigating the impacts of desalination on the environment, and of avoiding some of the dangers of the environment to desalination. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Experiments were designed to assess the uptake rates of 0.2, 1, and 5 µM ammonium by the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata maintained under different feeding regimes (highly fed, slightly fed, and starved) for 4–8 weeks. 15NH4 was used to follow the incorporation of nitrogen in the zooxanthellae or in the animal tissue and to calculate uptake rates. After 4 or 8 weeks, fed corals contained significantly higher concentrations of protein, chlorophyll, and zooxanthellae than starved nubbins. They also contained significantly higher amounts of carbon and nitrogen per unit surface skeleton. Results obtained showed that the algal fraction was enriched with 15N at up to 10 times the rate of the host, which suggests that the zooxanthellae are the primary site of assimilation. Uptake rates (measured in the algal fraction) varied according to the nitrogen concentration in seawater. They were {\~{}}20 times lower at 0.2 than at 1 or 5µM 15NH4 enrichment (2–30 vs. 120–510 ng N.h-1.cm-2 ) for both fed and starved nubbins. These rates were also affected by the feeding history of the host, because they were significantly lower for fed than for starved nubbins (analysis of variance, P {\textless} 0.005), at both high and low ammonium concentrations. On the basis of the nitrogen content of the zooxanthellae, we suggest that an external concentration of ammonium equal to 0.6 µM can sustain the growth of the zooxanthellae population.},

abstract = {We measured rates of ammonium and phosphate uptake into 12 microatolls at One Tree reef lagoon, Australia, on 14 occasions over a range of seasonal and meteorological conditions from 1993 to 1995. Nine of the microatolls were spiked with ammonia and/ or phosphate every low tide (2.5–4 h) during low- (15- month) and high- (13-month) loading periods. The remaining three microatolls that were not spiked with nutrient served as reference conditions. Ammonium concentrations were elevated from an average background of 0.7 to 11 mM NH4 during the low-loading period and 36 mM NH4 during the high-loading period, resulting in a loading to the benthos of 3.5 and 18 mmol NH4 m–2 low tide–1. Phosphate concentrations were elevated from an average background of 0.2 to 2.3 and 5.1 mM PO4 during low- and high-loading periods, respectively, resulting in a loading of 0.66 and 3.9 mmol PO4 m–2 low tide–1. Ammonium and phosphate concentrations decreased significantly over low-tides, and uptake rates were proportional to concentrations (firstorder). The average uptake-rate constant, S (m s–1), for ammonium and phosphate did not differ between the two loading periods but was highly variable. Averaged over both loading periods, S for ammonium was 129±74•10–6 m s–1 and S for phosphate was 67±39•10–6 m s–1. At background nutrient concentrations, estimated nutrient-uptake rates were 7.8 mmol NH4 m–2 day–1 and 1.2 mmol PO4 m–2 day–1. Excretion rates—calculated from the mean difference in uptake rates measured in reference and nutrientenrichedmicroatolls—were estimated to be 4.3 mmol NH4 m–2 day–1and0.9 mmol PO4 m–2 day–1.We reason and suggest that nutrient uptake rates in these microatolls were close to mass-transfer limited rates.Weconclude that nutrient uptake into coral reefs can behighly dynamic, varying 10-fold spatially and temporally.},

abstract = {Symbiotic associations are ubiquitous in terrestrial and marine environments and are of great ecological importance. The onset of a symbiotic relationship differs among associations. Symbionts can be vertically transmitted from host parent to offspring or they can be acquired horizontally from the surrounding environment with each new host generation. Cnidarian-algal symbioses, the subject of our study, exhibit both strategies. We investigated the clade identity of symbionts in soft coral hosts (Eilat, Red Sea) in relation to their hosts' mode of symbiont acquisition. We found for the first time that all hosts using horizontal transmission harbored symbionts belonging to Clade C while those with vertical transmission uniquely harbored symbionts from Clade A. The latter, capable of coping with a wide array of environmental conditions, evolved to be optimal vertically transmitted symbionts. The limitation of Clade A symbionts to hosts with vertical transmission suggests a coevolution of the hosts and symbionts. Clade C symbionts, characterized by large sub-clade variability, are found in corals with horizontal transmission and, most probably, each of its genotypes exhibits a more specialized set of physiological capabilities.},

abstract = {Many natural conditions cause expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals and sea anemones. Recent studies have focused on causes and mechanisms of this release. We examined an incidence of bleaching in a field population of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt). Our data suggest that expulsion of zooxanthellae was caused by reduced salinity from freshwater runoff after heavy rainfall. In the laboratory, A. elegantissima expelled zooxanthellae in quantities directly correlated with strength and duration of exposure to hyposalinity. The mechanism of release appears to be rupture of the host cell, followed by accumulation of clumps of zooxanthellae that are then expelled from the coelenteron. A. elegantissima has little or no ability to osmoregulate the water in its coelenteron, and internal salinity drops rapidly with external salinity reduction.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper deals with the effect of a long term (3 wk) change in salinity (increase or decrease of 2 to 4 psu) on the rates of photosynthesis and respiration of the zooxan- thellate coral Stylophora pistillata. Colonies were exposed to 4 levels of salinity (34, 36, 38 and 40 psu, with 38 psu as the control salinity) and results were compared using l-factor ANOVAs. Salinity had a significant effect on the protein con- centration. It was 30 {\%} higher at 38 psu than at the other salin- ities. It had also a significant effect on the rates of photosyn- thesis, respiration and on the P,:R ratio. Gross maximal photosynthetic rates were 50{\%} lower at 34, 36 and 40 psu than at 38 psu. The P,:R ratio was always higher at the control salinity. Most of the colonies maintained at 40 psu died, and this was explained by a very low P,:R ratio ({\textless}l). S, pistillata is therefore especially sensitive to small changes in salinity and seems to acclimate more easily to hypo- rather than to hyper- saline conditions. KEY},

abstract = {The life cycle of coral is affected by natural and anthropogenic perturbations occurring in the marine environment. In the context of global changes, it is likely that rainfall events will be more intense and that coastal reefs will be exposed to sudden drops in salinity. Therefore, a better understanding of how corals-especially during the pelagic life stages-are able to deal with declines in salinity is crucial. To fill this knowledge gap, this work investigated how gametes and larva stages of two species of Acropora (Acropora cytherea and Acropora pulchra) from French Polynesia cope with drops in salinity. An analysis of collected results highlights that both Acropora coral gametes displayed the same resistance to salinity changes, with 4h30-ES50(effective salinity that decrease by 50{\%} the fertilization success after 4h30 exposure) of 26.6±0.1 and 27.5±0.3‰ for A.cytherea and A.pulchra, respectively. This study also revealed that coral gametes were more sensitive to decreases in salinity than larvae, for which significant changes are only observed at 26‰ for A.cytherea after 14d of exposure. Although rising seawater temperatures and ocean acidification are often perceived as the main threat for the survival of coral reefs, our work indicates that 70{\%} of the gametes could be killed during a single night of spawning by a rainfall event that decreases salinity to 26‰. This suggests that changes in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events associated with climate changes should be taken seriously in efforts to both preserve coral gametes and ensure the persistence and renewal of coral populations.},

abstract = {Developments leading to the new practical salinity scale and equation of state for seawater, introduced by the Joint Panel on Oceanographic Tables and Standards (JPOTS), are reviewed. The laboratory measurements used to construct the new empirical formulas for converting conductivity ratios to salinity and for estimating seawater density from salinity, temperature, and pressure were made on samples of standard seawater to minimize the effects of compositional variations. Measured densities were fitted with a standard deviation of 0.0036 kg/m3 at atmospheric pressure and 0.009 kg/m3 over the oceanic pressure range. Natural seawater densities can differ from computed density by as much as 0.05 kg/m3 because of variations in the composition of dissolved salts that are not reflected equivalently in measured conductivity ratios. Differences from the previous Knudsen-Ekman equation of state are also of comparable magnitude. Values of specific volume anomaly for geopotential anomaly computations for estimation of geostrophic currents and transport are not significantly modified. Algorithms adopted by the JPOTS for computing adiabatic lapse rate and potential temperature are compared with formulas derived from the new equation of state. Potential temperatures agree within 2×10−3°C over the oceanic range of temperature and pressure at salinity of 35.},

abstract = {The response of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata to short-term (min to h) and long-term (d) exposure to reduced-salinity seawater was examined. Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to assess the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates (dark-adapted Fv/Fm) in the coral tissues (in hospite) before, during and after exposure. Exposure to reduced-salinity seawater caused a marked reduction in efficiency (the ratio of variable [Fv] to maximal [Fm] fluorescence), and there was an apparent link between a reduc- tion in dark-adapted Fv/Fm and a loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the corals. The reduction in Fv/Fm of the symbiotic algae and subsequent dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis (coral bleach- ing) occurred during exposure to reduced-salinity seawater in either the light or dark. The results demonstrate that bleaching in response to low-salinity seawater is a truly sublethal response, contra- ry to a recent suggestion. The study also suggests that bleaching of corals in response to low-salinity seawater may not involve the passive loss of algal symbionts and that an impairment of the capacity of the algal symbionts for photosynthesis represents a common ‘cue' initiating the dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis during exposure to sub-optimal conditions. This study demonstrates how ex- posure to low-salinity seawater alone can cause some of the symptoms commonly attributed to temperature anomalies and anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs.},

The dominant species within these habitats is Siderastrea radians, which can reach densities of up to 68 colonies m- 2and is commonly exposed to salinity extremes ({\textless} 10 psu to {\textgreater} 37 psu) and chronic sediment burial. In this study, we document the patterns of resistance and resilience of S. radians to sub-optimal salinity levels and sediment burial in a series of short-term, long-term, acute, chronic, single-stressor, and sequential-stressor experiments. S. radians displayed remarkable patterns of resistance and resilience and mortality was documented only under prolonged (≥ 48 h) continuous exposure to salinity extremes (15 and 45 psu) and chronic sediment burial. A reduction in photosynthetic rates was documented for all salinity exposures and the decrease in photosynthesis was linearly related to exposure time. Negative impacts on photosynthetic rates were more severe under low salinity (15 psu) than under high salinity (45 psu). Corals exposed to intermediate, low-salinity levels (25 psu), exhibited initial declines in photosynthesis that were followed by temporary increases that may represent transient acclimatization patterns. The impacts of sediment burial were influenced by the duration of the burial period and ranged from a temporary reduction in photosynthesis to significant reductions in growth and tissue mortality. The maintenance of P/R ratios {\textgreater} 1 and the rapid ({\textless} 24 h) recovery of photosynthetic rates after burial periods of 2-24 h indicates that S. radians is able to resist short-term burial periods with minor physiological consequences. However, as burial periods increase and colonies become covered at multiple chronic intervals, sediment burial resulted in extended photosynthetic recovery periods, reduced growth, and mortality. Under normal conditions (i.e., no salinity stress), S. radians was very effective at clearing sediments, and {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the colonies' surface area was cleared within 1 h. However, clearing rates were influenced by physiological status, and prior exposure to sub-optimal salinity significantly reduced the clearing rates of stressed colonies. The response of S. radians to disturbance documented in this study characterizes this species as highly stress-tolerant and provides an explanation for its present high abundance in both reef and marginal environments. Moreover, the key life-history attributes of S. radians, such as brooding reproductive strategy, small colony size, high stress-tolerance, and high recruitment rates, suggest the potential for this species to replace reef-building taxa under increased disturbance scenarios in Florida and elsewhere in the region. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper a Reference Composition consisting of the major components of Atlantic surface seawater is determined using these earlier analytical measurements. The stoichiometry of sea salt introduced here is thus based on the most accurate prior determination of the composition, adjusted to achieve charge balance and making use of the 2005 atomic weights. Reference Seawater is defined as any seawater that has the Reference Composition and a new Reference-Composition Salinity SRis defined to provide the best available estimate of the Absolute Salinity of both Reference Seawater and the Standard Seawater that was used in the measurements of the physical properties. From a practical point of view, the value of SRcan be related to the Practical Salinity S by SR=(35.16504/35)gkg-1×S. Reference Seawater that has been “normalized” to a Practical Salinity of 35 has a Reference-Composition Salinity of exactly SR=35.16504 g kg−1. The new independent salinity variable SRis intended to be used as the concentration variable for future thermodynamic functions of seawater, as an SI-based extension of Practical Salinity, as a reference for natural seawater composition anomalies, as the currently best estimate for Absolute Salinity of IAPSO Standard Seawater, and as a theoretical model for the electrolyte mixture “seawater”.},

abstract = {Scleractinian corals are assumed to be stenohaline osmoconformers, although they are frequently subjected to variations in seawater salinity due to precipitation, freshwater runoff, and other processes. Observed responses to altered salinity levels include differences in photosynthetic performance, respiration, and increased bleaching and mortality of the coral host and its algal symbiont, but a study looking at bacterial community changes is lacking. Here we exposed the coral Fungia granulosa to strongly increased salinity levels in short- and long-term experiments to disentangle temporal and compartment effects of the coral holobiont (i.e. coral host, symbiotic algae, and associated bacteria). Our results show a significant reduction in calcification and photosynthesis, but a stable microbiome after short-term exposure to high salinity levels. By comparison, long-term exposure yielded unchanged photosynthesis levels and visually healthy coral colonies indicating long-term acclimation to high salinity levels that were accompanied by a major coral microbiome restructuring. Importantly, a bacterium in the family Rhodobacteraceae was succeeded by Pseudomonas veronii as the numerically most abundant taxon. Further, taxonomy-based functional profiling indicates a shift in the bacterial community towards increased osmolyte production, sulfur oxidation, and nitrogen fixation. Our study highlights that bacterial community composition in corals can change within days to weeks under altered environmental conditions, where shifts in the microbiome may enable adjustment of the coral to a more advantageous holobiont composition.

abstract = {Coral reefs can experience extreme salinity changes, particularly hypo-salinity, as a result of storms, heavy rainy seasons (e.g., monsoons), and coastal runoff. Field and laboratory observations have documented that corals exposed to hypo-saline conditions can undergo extensive bleaching and mortality. There is controversy in the literature as to whether hypo-saline conditions induce a pathological response in corals, and if there is a relationship between decreasing salinity treatment and pathological responses. To test the hypothesis that hypo-salinity exposure does not have a pathological effect on coral, we used histological and cellular diagnostic methods to characterize the pathology in hypo-salinity-exposed corals. Colonies of Stylophora pistillata were exposed to five salinity concentrations [39 parts per thousand (ppt), 32 ppt, 28 ppt, 24 ppt, and 20 ppt] that may realistically occur on a reef. Histological examination indicated an increasing severity of pathomorphologies associated with decreasing salinity, including increased tissue swelling, degradation and loss of zooxanthellae, and tissue necrosis. Pulse-amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorimetry kinetics demonstrated a decreasing photosynthetic efficiency with decreasing salinity conditions. Cytochrome P450 levels were affected by even slight changes in salinity concentration suggesting that detoxification pathways, as well as several endocrine pathways, may be adversely affected. Finally, these studies demonstrated that hypo-saline conditions can induce an oxidative-stress response in both the host and in its algal symbiont, and in so doing, may synergistically increase oxidative-stress burdens. As with other types of environmental stresses, exposure to hypo-saline conditions may have long-term consequences on coral physiology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

There also was an increase in freshwater run-off from the watershed of the Baltic Proper. Seawater salinity correlated negatively with freshwater run-off with a time lag of several years. The abundance percentages of most dominant zooplankton species correlated significantly with salinity, either positively (large neritic copepods), or negatively (freshwater cladocerans). All data sets together indicate close connection between the functioning of the pelagic Baltic Sea ecosystem and large-scale weather patterns over the run-off area.},

abstract = {Salinity tolerances of reef corals have been experimentally investigated since the early twentieth century. Yet, nearly 100 years later, we are no closer to having a threshold that can be applied in studies of the impacts of freshwater runoff on coral communities. We present an empirically derived salinity threshold for sensitive Acropora species from the Keppel Islands in the southern inshore Great Barrier Reef (GBR), based on in situ salinity exposure and coral responses during a major flood event in 2010–2011. This threshold is presented as a dose-time response for a salinity-sensitive range of 22–28 PSU and an exposure time of 3–16 days at the lowest and highest salinities, respectively. The robustness of the salinity threshold was confirmed by comparison with responses of corals to low salinity {\~{}}600 km north in the central GBR, which were exposed to substantially different turbidity and chlorophyll levels during the period of hypo-salinity.},

abstract = {The cycling of ammonium between the cnidarian animal host and intracellular symbiotic algae was investigated in the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata , obtained from the Gulf of Eilat. Excretion of ammonium into the surrounding water by freshly collected corals was not detectable because of efficient recycling of inorganic nitrogen between the symbionts. Excretion into surrounding water was induced by incubation in the dark, by treatment with the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor DCMU, and by treatment with azaserine, an inhibitor of glutamine 2-oxoglutarate amido transferase (GOGAT). The results suggest that GDH activity and dark respiration rates may be used to estimate quantitatively the rate of ammonium excretion in S. pistillata . From knowledge of the nitrogen content per unit area of zooxanthellae and animal tissue, the mitotic index of the algae, and the calculated excretion rate of the animal, the authors constructed a nitrogen budget for the coral. The calculations suggest that recycled nitrogen accounts for 90{\%} of the zooxanthellae nitrogen demand, and that nitrogen turns over at a rate of 0.13 per day in the algae and 0.013 per day within the animal tissue.},

The peculiar orientation of its exumbrella against the sediment is believed to be associated with its mainly autotrophic nutrition, i.e. exposing its zooxanthellae-bearing photosynthetic oral appendages to the sunlight. Here we show that the jellyfish also acts as a nutrient pump, drawing nutrient-rich pore waters from the permeable sediments. Depletion of pore-water ammonium in situ, light-enhanced ammonium uptake, and high rates of photosynthesis determined via oxygen flux measurements and underwater fluorometer analysis (rapid light curves) show that Cassiopea sp. effectively harnesses pore-water nutrients. At high densities Cassiopea sp. may facilitate benthic-pelagic coupling and primary production in oligotrophic coral reefs.},

abstract = {Rising ocean temperatures associated with global climate change are causing mass coral bleaching and mortality worldwide1. Understanding the genetic and environmental factors that mitigate coral bleaching susceptibility may aid local management efforts to help coral reefs survive climate change. Although bleaching susceptibility depends partly on the genetic identity of a coral's algal symbionts2, the effect of symbiont density, and the factors controlling it, remain poorly understood. By applying a new metric of symbiont density3 to study the coral Pocillopora damicornis during seasonal warming and acute bleaching, we show that symbiont cell ratio density is a function of both symbiont type and environmental conditions, and that corals with high densities are more susceptible to bleaching. Higher vulnerability of corals with more symbionts establishes a quantitative mechanistic link between symbiont density and the molecular basis for coral bleaching, and indicates that high densities do not buffer corals from thermal stress, as has been previously suggested4. These results indicate that environmental conditions that increase symbiont densities, such as nutrient pollution5, 6, will exacerbate climate-change-induced coral bleaching, providing a mechanistic explanation for why local management to reduce these stressors will help coral reefs survive future warming.},

The responses of each of these groups are evaluated separately against the four main water quality parameters: (1) increased dissolved inorganic nutrients, (2) enrichment with particulate organic matter, (3) light reduction from turbidity and (4) increased sedimentation. This separation facilitates disentangling and understanding the mechanisms leading to changes in the field, where many contaminants and many responses co-occur. The review also summarises geographic and biological factors that determine local and regional levels of resistance and resilience to degradation.

After 4 or 8 weeks, fed corals contained significantly higher concentrations of protein, chlorophyll, and zooxanthellae than starved nubbins. They also contained significantly higher amounts of carbon and nitrogen per unit surface skeleton. Results obtained showed that the algal fraction was enriched with 15N at up to 10 times the rate of the host, which suggests that the zooxanthellae are the primary site of assimilation. Uptake rates (measured in the algal fraction) varied according to the nitrogen concentration in seawater.

These rates were also affected by the feeding history of the host, because they were significantly lower for fed than for starved nubbins (analysis of variance, P {\textless} 0.005), at both high and low ammonium concentrations. On the basis of the nitrogen content of the zooxanthellae, we suggest that an external concentration of ammonium equal to 0.6 µM can sustain the growth of the zooxanthellae population.},

abstract = {Recent advances in vectorial proteomics of protein domains exposed to the surface of photosynthetic thylakoid membranes of plants and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii allowed mapping of in vivo phosphorylation sites in integral and peripheral membrane proteins. In plants, significant changes of thylakoid protein phosphorylation are observed in response to stress, particularly in photosystem II under high light or high temperature stress. Thylakoid protein phosphorylation in the algae is much more responsive to the ambient redox and light conditions, as well as to CO2availability. The light-dependent multiple and differential phosphorylation of CP29 linker protein in the green algae is suggested to control photosynthetic state transitions and uncoupling of light harvesting proteins from photosystem II under high light. The similar role for regulation of the dynamic distribution of light harvesting proteins in plants is proposed for the TSP9 protein, which together with other recently discovered peripheral proteins undergoes specific environment- and redox-dependent phosphorylation at the thylakoid surface. This review focuses on the environmentally modulated reversible phosphorylation of thylakoid proteins related to their membrane dynamics and affinity towards particular photosynthetic protein complexes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The primary objectives were to (1) examine the spatial pattern of coral bleaching and its relationship to coral community composition and habitat and (2) determine the relationship between environmental parameters and coral-bleaching prevalence (i.e. the proportion of colonies that bleached within each population). Over 50{\%} of all coral species bleached along much of the reef tract in 2005. The Lower Keys supported more colonies per unit area than elsewhere and showed the highest number of bleached coral colonies; Biscayne and the Middle Keys showed the highest coral-bleaching prevalence. The most thermally sensitive corals were Porites furcata, Millepora complanata, Siderastrea radians, Porites divaricata, Agaricia agaricites, Millepora alcicornis, and Porites porites. The most extensive bleaching was recorded for large colonies, ≥30 cm, except in 2005 when small branching Porites colonies ({\textless}30 cm) showed higher bleaching prevalence. Shallow-water coral colonies and corals at localities with high productivity, in the form of chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration, showed higher bleaching prevalence than both deep coral colonies and corals at localities with low productivity. By locally regulating waste-water discharge from the land, and thereby reducing local primary productivity, the severity of coral bleaching may be reduced when subjected to high regional water temperatures.},

abstract = {The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Here, the additional role of poor water quality in lowering the thermal tolerance (i.e. bleaching 'resistance') of symbiotic reef corals is considered. In particular, a quantitative linkage is established between terrestrially-sourced dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) loading and the upper thermal bleaching thresholds of inshore reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Significantly, this biophysical linkage provides concrete evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of corals reefs to global climate change. Indeed, for inshore reef areas with a high runoff exposure risk, it is shown that the potential benefit of this 'local' management imperative is equivalent to ∼2.0-2.5 °C in relation to the upper thermal bleaching limit; though in this case, a potentially cost-prohibitive reduction in end-of-river DIN of {\textgreater}50-80{\%} would be required. An integrated socio-economic modelling framework is outlined that will assist future efforts to understand (optimise) the alternate tradeoffs that the water quality/coral bleaching linkage presents.

On the other hand, calcification rates only increased 1.3-fold, suggesting that even moderate nutrient loading resulted in one-sided enhancement of the algal photosynthetic activity. The measured C fixation ratios of organic C : skeletal C were higher than the structural ratios, and the inconsistency became greater as Chl a concentration increased.

abstract = {Dinitrogen (N2) fixation by specialized prokaryotes (diazotrophs) represents an important source of bioavailable nitrogen (N) in the ocean. In coral reefs, several substrates and organisms are associated with diazotrophs, but potential N2 fixation activity by zooxanthellate soft corals has not been investigated yet. Such soft corals may importantly contribute to the input of new N into the reef ecosystem as they can cover substantial benthic areas in today's coral reefs. Therefore, this study investigated N2 fixation of two dominant zooxanthellate soft coral groups (Sarcophyton sp. and Xeniidae) in a Northern Red Sea fringing reef during all four seasons of one year. This was supplemented by respirometry incubations and in-situ monitoring of key environmental parameters. Findings revealed detectable N2 fixation for both soft corals during all seasons. Annual N2 fixation by Sarcophyton sp. was 3-times higher than that of Xeniidae, but both soft corals exhibited similar seasonal patterns. N2 fixation significantly increased during summer, when water temperature and light intensity were highest, and inorganic nutrient availability was lowest. Coral respiration also peaked during summer and was positively correlated to N2 fixation, while photosynthesis revealed maximum rates during the nutrient-enriched spring season. Given the importance of N for reproduction and growth, N2 fixation may be a key component of soft coral nutrition during summer, when inorganic nutrient availability in the water column is lowest and likely not sufficient to sustain the high metabolic demand of soft corals.},

abstract = {Tropical coral reefs are among the most productive and diverse ecosystems, despite being surrounded by ocean waters where nutrients are in short supply. Benthic dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a significant internal source of "new" nitrogen (N) in reef ecosystems, but related information appears to be sparse. Here, we review the current state (and gaps) of knowledge on N2 fixation associated with coral reef organisms and their ecosystems. By summarizing the existing literature, we show that benthic N2 fixation is an omnipresent process in tropical reef environments. Highest N2 fixation rates are detected in reef-associated cyanobacterial mats and sea grass meadows, clearly showing the significance of these functional groups, if present, to the input of new N in reef ecosystems. Nonetheless, key benthic organisms such as hard corals also importantly contribute to benthic N2 fixation in the reef. Given the usually high coral coverage of healthy reef systems, these results indicate that benthic symbiotic associations may be more important than previously thought. In fact, mutualisms between carbon (C) and N2 fixers have likely evolved that may enable reef communities to mitigate N limitation. We then explore the potential effects of the increasing human interferences on the process of benthic reef N2 fixation via changes in diazotrophic populations, enzymatic activities, or availability of benthic substrates favorable to these microorganisms. Current knowledge indicates positive effects of ocean acidification, warming, and deoxygenation and negative effects of increased ultraviolet radiation on the amount of N fixed in coral reefs. Eutrophication may either boost or suppress N2 fixation, depending on the nutrient becoming limiting. As N2 fixation appears to play a fundamental role in nutrient-limited reef ecosystems, these assumptions need to be expanded and confirmed by future research efforts addressing the knowledge gaps identified in this review.},

abstract = {Coral atoll communities are of spe- cial interest to marine biologists since they flourish in tropical waters charac- terized by low productivity (cf. Stod- dart 1969). One of the aims of research in coral reef biology is to discern and describe quantitatively the adaptations that permit reef communities to exploit a marginally suitable habitat. Vital to this aim is an understanding of the nutrition of corals themselves since these lime-secreting cnidarians are the dominant life forms of many reefs and one of the principal reef builders. The general topic of coral nutrition has been reviewed recently (Muscatine 1973, Taylor 1973a) and serves as a convenient point of departure. The pres- ent discussion considers the potential nutritional capabilities of corals as mu- tualistic symbioses and the extent to which specific organismic and ecological manifestations of these capabilities have been described and quantified.},

Phosphate supplementation alone had no effect. The increase in zooxanthellae numbers was linearly proportional to the increase in protein in zooxanthellae, suggesting that availability of inorganic nitrogen leads to increased protein synthesis in zooxanthellae. Feeding on Artemia alone or together with phosphate had no effect on the population density of zooxanthellae. Feeding on Artemia and ammonium produced a small increase in population density but it was not statistically significant. The small effect could be due to insufficient influx of ammonium in fed animals, or growth of both animal and algae resulting in little or no net change in the population density of zooxanthellae. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the growth of zooxanthellae in S pistillata from the Red Sea is nitrogen limited.},

abstract = {During the past two decades coral reefs in the greater Caribbean area have been altered by phase shifts away from corals and toward macroalgae or algal turfs. This study tested the hypothesis that because the phase shift on reefs in Jamaica and southeast Florida involved frondose macroalgae, bottom-up control via nutrient enrichment must be a causal factor. The approach was multifaceted and included measurement of near-bottom nutrient concentrations, salinity, nutrient enrichment bioassays, alkaline phosphatase assays, tissue C : N : P ratios, and tissue 15N : 14N (6”N) ratios. In both locations, concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) exceeded nutrient thresholds (- 1 .O PM DIN, 0.1 PM SRP) noted to sustain macroalgal blooms on Caribbean coral reefs. High seawater DIN : SRP ratios, alkaline phosphatase activity, and tissue C : P and N : P ratios of macroalgae on the carbonate-rich Jamaican reef suggested SRP limitation of productivity compared to lower values of these variables on siliciclastic reefs in Florida that suggested DIN limitation. This pattern was corroborated experimentally when SRP enrichment increased P,,,, (photosynthetic capacity at light saturation) of the chlorophyte Chaetomorpha Zinum in Jamaica compared to DIN enrichment that increased (x (the photosynthetic efficiency under low irradiance) of the deeper growing chlorophyte Codium isthmocladum in southeast Florida. Increased DIN concentrations were associated with reduced salinity on both reefs, indicating submarine groundwatcr discharge was a significant source of DIN. Elevated S15N values of C. isthmocladum tissue further pointed to wastewater DIN as a source of nitrogen contributing to the blooms in southeast Florida.},

abstract = {The coral holobiont is a dynamic assemblage of the coral animal, zooxanthellae, endolithic algae and fungi, Bacteria,Archaea and viruses. Zooxanthellae and some Bacteria form relatively stable and species-specific associations with corals. Other associations are less specific; coral-associated Archaea differ from those in the water column, but the same archaeal species may be found on different coral species. It has been hypothesized that the coral animal can adapt to differing ecological niches by 'switching' its microbial associates. In the case of corals and zooxanthellae, this has been termed adaptive bleaching and it has important implications for carbon cycling within the coral holobiont and ultimately the survival of coral reefs. However, the roles of other components of the coral holobiont are essentially unknown. To better understand these other coral associates, a fractionation procedure was used to separate the microbes, mitochondria and viruses from the coral animal cells and zooxanthellae. The resulting metagenomic DNA was sequenced using pyrosequencing. Fungi, Bacteria and phage were the most commonly identified organisms in the metagenome. Three of the four fungal phyla were represented, including a wide diversity of fungal genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that the endolithic community is more important than previously appreciated. In particular, the data suggested that endolithic fungi could be converting nitrate and nitrite to ammonia, which would enable fixed nitrogen to cycle within the coral holobiont. The most prominent bacterial groups were Proteobacteria (68{\%}), Firmicutes (10{\%}), Cyanobacteria (7{\%}) and Actinobacteria (6{\%}). Functionally, the bacterial community was primarily heterotrophic and included a number of pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds, the most abundant being the homogentisate pathway. The most abundant phage family was the ssDNA Microphage and most of the eukaryotic viruses were most closely related to those known to infect aquatic organisms. This study provides a metabolic and taxonomic snapshot of microbes associated with the reef-building coral Porites astreoides and presents a basis for understanding how coral-microbial interactions structure the holobiont and coral reefs.},

abstract = {Mass coral bleaching, resulting from the breakdown of coral–algal symbiosis has been identified as the most severe threat to coral reef survival on a global scale1. Regionally, nutrient enrichment of reef waters is often associated with a significant loss of coral cover and diversity2. Recently, increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations have been linked to a reduction of the temperature threshold of coral bleaching3, a phenomenon for which no mechanistic explanation is available. Here we show that increased levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in combination with limited phosphate concentrations result in an increased susceptibility of corals to temperature- and light-induced bleaching. Mass spectrometric analyses of the algal lipidome revealed a marked accumulation of sulpholipids under these conditions. Together with increased phosphatase activities, this change indicates that the imbalanced supply of dissolved inorganic nitrogen results in phosphate starvation of the symbiotic algae. Based on these findings we introduce a conceptual model that links unfavourable ratios of dissolved inorganic nutrients in the water column with established mechanisms of coral bleaching. Notably, this model improves the understanding of the detrimental effects of coastal nutrient enrichment on coral reefs, which is urgently required to support knowledge-based management strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change.},

abstract = {Assimilation of inorganic nitrogen from nutrient-poor tropical seas is an essential challenge for the endosymbiosis between reef-building corals and dinoflagellates. Despite the clear evidence that reef-building corals can use ammonium as inorganic nitrogen source, the dynamics and precise roles of host and symbionts in this fundamental process remain unclear. Here, we combine high spatial resolution ion microprobe imaging (NanoSIMS) and pulse-chase isotopic labeling in order to track the dynamics of ammonium incorporation within the intact symbiosis between the reef-building coral Acropora aspera and its dinoflagellate symbionts. We demonstrate that both dinoflagellate and animal cells have the capacity to rapidly fix nitrogen from seawater enriched in ammonium (in less than one hour). Further, by establishing the relative strengths of the capability to assimilate nitrogen for each cell compartment, we infer that dinoflagellate symbionts can fix 14 to 23 times more nitrogen than their coral host cells in response to a sudden pulse of ammonium-enriched seawater. Given the importance of nitrogen in cell maintenance, growth and functioning, the capability to fix ammonium from seawater into the symbiotic system may be a key component of coral nutrition. Interestingly, this metabolic response appears to be triggered rapidly by episodic nitrogen availability. The methods and results presented in this study open up for the exploration of dynamics and spatial patterns associated with metabolic activities and nutritional interactions in a multitude of organisms that live in symbiotic relationships.},

Shifts in its composition often correlate with the appearance of signs of diseases and/or bleaching, thus suggesting a link between microbes, coral health and stability of reef ecosystems. The understanding of interactions in coral-associated microbiota is informed by the on-going characterization of other microbiomes, which suggest that metabolic pathways and functional capabilities define the ‘core' microbiota more accurately than the taxonomic diversity of its members. Consistent with this hypothesis, there does not appear to be a consensus on the specificity in the interactions of corals with microbial commensals, even though recent studies report potentially beneficial functions of the coral-associated bacteria. They cycle sulphur, fix nitrogen, produce antimicrobial compounds, inhibit cell-to-cell signalling and disrupt virulence in opportunistic pathogens. While their beneficial functions have been documented, it is not certain whether or how these microbes are selected by the hosts. Therefore, understanding the role of innate immunity, signal and nutrient exchange in the establishment of coral microbiota and in controlling its functions will probably reveal ancient, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that dictate the outcomes of host–microbial interactions, and impact the resilience of the host.},

abstract = {The dual character of corals, that they are both auto- and heterotrophs, was recognized early in the twentieth Century. It is generally accepted that the symbiotic association between corals and their endosymbiotic algae (called zooxanthellae) is fundamental to the development of coral reefs in oligotrophic tropical oceans because zooxanthellae transfer the major part of their photosynthates to the coral host (autotrophic nutrition). However, numerous studies have confirmed that many species of corals are also active heterotrophs, ingesting organisms ranging from bacteria to mesozooplankton. Heterotrophy accounts for between 0 and 66{\%} of the fixed carbon incorporated into coral skeletons and can meet from 15 to 35{\%} of daily metabolic requirements in healthy corals and up to 100{\%} in bleached corals. Apart from this carbon input, feeding is likely to be important to most scleractinian corals, since nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that cannot be supplied from photosynthesis by the coral's symbiotic algae must come from zooplankton capture, particulate matter or dissolved compounds. A recent study showed that during bleaching events some coral species, by increasing their feeding rates, are able to maintain and restore energy reserves. This review assesses the importance and effects of heterotrophy in tropical scleractinian corals.We first provide background information on the different food sources (from dissolved organic matter to meso- and macrozooplankton). We then consider the nutritional inputs of feeding. Finally, we review feeding effects on the different physiological parameters of corals (tissue composition, photosynthesis and skeletal growth).},

abstract = {Nutrient loading is one of the strongest drivers of marine habitat degradation. Yet, the link between nutrients and disease epizootics in marine organisms is often tenuous and supported only by correlative data. Here, we present experimental evidence that chronic nutrient exposure leads to increases in both disease prevalence and severity and coral bleaching in scleractinian corals, the major habitat-forming organisms in tropical reefs. Over 3 years, from June 2009 to June 2012, we continuously exposed areas of a coral reef to elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. At the termination of the enrichment, we surveyed over 1200 scleractinian corals for signs of disease or bleaching. Siderastrea siderea corals within enrichment plots had a twofold increase in both the prevalence and severity of disease compared with corals in unenriched control plots. In addition, elevated nutrient loading increased coral bleaching; Agaricia spp. of corals exposed to nutrients suffered a 3.5-fold increase in bleaching frequency relative to control corals, providing empirical support for a hypothesized link between nutrient loading and bleaching-induced coral declines. However, 1 year later, after nutrient enrichment had been terminated for 10 months, there were no differences in coral disease or coral bleaching prevalence between the previously enriched and control treatments. Given that our experimental enrichments were well within the ranges of ambient nutrient concentrations found on many degraded reefs worldwide, these data provide strong empirical support to the idea that coastal nutrient loading is one of the major factors contributing to the increasing levels of both coral disease and coral bleaching. Yet, these data also suggest that simple improvements to water quality may be an effective way to mitigate some coral disease epizootics and the corresponding loss of coral cover in the future.},

abstract = {Enrichment of reef environments with dissolved inorganic nutrients is considered a major threat to the survival of corals living in symbiosis with dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.). We argue, however, that the direct negative effects on the symbiosis are not necessarily caused by the nutrient enrichment itself but by the phosphorus starvation of the algal symbionts that can be caused by skewed nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios. We exposed corals to imbalanced N:P ratios in long-term experiments and found that the undersupply of phosphate severely disturbed the symbiosis, indicated by the loss of coral biomass, malfunctioning of algal photosynthesis and bleaching of the corals. In contrast, the corals tolerated an undersupply with nitrogen at high phosphate concentrations without negative effects on symbiont photosynthesis, suggesting a better adaptation to nitrogen limitation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the signatures of ultrastructural biomarkers represent versatile tools for the classification of nutrient stress in symbiotic algae. Notably, high N:P ratios in the water were clearly identified by the accumulation of uric acid crystals.},

abstract = {Corals are animals that form close mutualistic associations with endosymbiotic photosynthetic algae of the genus Symbiodinium. Together they provide the calcium carbonate framework of coral reef ecosystems. The importance of the microbiome (i.e., bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) to holobiont functioning has only recently been recognized. Given that growth and density of Symbiodinium within the coral host is highly dependent on nitrogen availability, nitrogen-cycling microbes may be of fundamental importance to the stability of the coral-algae symbiosis and holobiont functioning, in particular under nutrient-enriched and -depleted scenarios. We summarize what is known about nitrogen cycling in corals and conclude that disturbance of microbial nitrogen cycling may be tightly linked to coral bleaching and disease.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment is often associated with coral reef decline. Consequently, there is a large consent that increased nutrient influxes in reef waters have negative longterm consequences for corals. However, the mechanisms by which dissolved inorganic nutrients can disturb corals and their symbiotic algae are subject to controversial debate. Herein, we discuss recent studies that demonstrate how nutrient enrichment affects the heat and light stress tolerance of corals and their bleaching susceptibility. We integrate direct and indirect effects of nutrient enrichment on corals in a model that explains why healthy coral reefs can exist over a rather broad range of natural nutrient environments at the lower end of the concentration scale and that anthropogenic nutrient enrichment can disturb the finely balanced processes via multiple pathways. We conceptualise that corals can suffer from secondary negative nutrient effects due to the alteration of their natural nutrient environment by increased phytoplankton loads. In this context, we suggest that phytoplankton represents a likely vector that can translate nutrients effects, induced for instance by coastal run-off, into nutrient stress on coral reefs in considerable distance to the site of primary nutrient enrichment. The presented synthesis of the literature suggests that the effects of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication beyond certain thresholds are negative for the physiological performance of the coral individual for ecosystem functioning. Hence, the immediate implementation of knowledge-based nutrient management strategies is crucial for coral reef survival. {\textcopyright} 2013.},
